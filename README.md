Agriculture is crucial around the world as it involves every person on the planet. To enable further developments in the field of autonomous precision agriculture, the system proposed is an open source hardware and software platform. This system is designed to autonomously move using a modified pose to pose Dubins path whilst completing precision seed planting using low cost methods. A Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module can store the geospatial location of each seed planted into a database with an accuracy that can be used for the system to revisit the planted seeds. The system employs the use of a commercial off the shelf (COTS) kit, low cost COTS seeder and Raspberry Pi. This system is built to be part of a swarm.

This repository is part of a dissertation and publication. Hardware can be found in the Hardware folder. The desktop applicaiton can be deployed using client.py.
